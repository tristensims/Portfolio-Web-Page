                        <p> Back in high school I first saw code in a web design class. It was a basic HTML/CSS class but I loved it. 
                            Unfortunatly I took a different turn when I went to art college, but it didnt have that same spark as coding had. </p>
                        <p>After leaving art college, I just worked in fast food, even making it up to being a general manager. Though that didnt last all too long, but I got great team work skills that 
                            has helped me adapt better to new enviroments. </p>
                        <p> Then my sister pointed me to Thinkful to actually persue something that brought me joy. Doing the course so far has made me excited to get into this field and start enjoying
                            life and help others. </p>
